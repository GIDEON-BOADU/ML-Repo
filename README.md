# ðŸ©º Heart Disease Predictor (ML-Powered)

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on historical medical data.  
It leverages the **Random Forest Classifier** for high accuracy and is built using **Python** with the **Scikit-learn** framework.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GIDEON-BOADU/ML-Repo.git
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the training script (preferably in VS Code):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
5. Use ```predict.py``` to test new inputs.
