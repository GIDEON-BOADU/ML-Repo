** Heart Disease Predictor (ML-Powered)
**
This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on historical medical data. 
It leverages the Random Forest Classifier for high accuracy, and is built using Python with the Scikit-learn framework.

 **Project Overview**
**Goal:** Predict heart disease (yes/no) based on medical features
**Dataset:** UCI Heart Disease dataset
**Framework:** Scikit-learn
**Tools:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib
